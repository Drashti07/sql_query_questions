Calculate the ratio of the total spend a customer spent on each order. Output the customerâ€™s first name, order details, and ratio of the order cost to their total spend across all orders.


Assume each customer has a unique first name (i.e., there is only 1 customer named Karen in the dataset) and that customers place at most only 1 order a day.


Percentages should be represented as decimals
