As a data scientist at Amazon Prime Video, you are tasked with enhancing the in-flight entertainment experience for Amazonâ€™s airline partners. Your challenge is to develop a feature that suggests individual movies from Amazon's content database that fit within a given flight's duration. For flight 101, find movies whose runtime is less than or equal to the flight's duration.


The output should list suggested movies for the flight, including 'flight_id', 'movie_id', and 'movie_duration'."
